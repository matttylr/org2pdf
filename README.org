* Introduction: org2pdf

Publishing documents authored in org-mode to PDF is a bit tricky.
Latex is hardly the easiest environment to learn or use and in my
experience org-export-as-pdf is less than reliable.

In this day and age there is a less stressful solution: publish to
HTML and then convert to PDF using the wonders of CSS and PrinceXML.

Here how to get a simple publishing workflow up and running.

The stylesheet included is entirely setup for my own purposes but you
should be able to alter it to fit your own needs without too much
bother.

PrinceXML is free for personal use but this version inserts a logo on
the first page.

* Instructions

** Usage: To publish this document to PDF run:

./make-pdf.sh "README.org"

** Dependencies

  * Emacs - Current stock version of GNU Emacs packaged in Ubuntu
   	Oneiric is known to work.

   	wget http://www.princexml.com/download/prince_8.0-1ubuntu10.04_i386.deb
